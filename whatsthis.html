        The domain <a href="https://maruko.it/">maruko.it</a> was booked on Dec 29 over <a href="https://domains.google.com/">GoogleDomains</a> at a fairly NOT cheap price<br> because I'm still ignorant on several things and venture too much when dealing
        with money.

        Also, fun fact: as you can tell by the little lock over the upper-left corner,this site serves
        <mark>https</mark>!<br> I totally didn't spend hours figuring out how to enable it (not difficult).
