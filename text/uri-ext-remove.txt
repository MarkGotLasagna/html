Removing file extensions from URIs, such as .html or .php, is as simple 
as adding a directive into the "location /" of the server. 
The code only operates on external URIs that are visible to the user.

location / {
    if ($request_uri ~ ^/(.*)\.html) {
        return 302 /$1;
    }
    try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/ =404;
}
